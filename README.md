# UFC - Utilities For Cloud Projects

These are a collection many utility classes and tools used in my personal cloud and serverless projects.

The NPM package was prepared following the tips from [this guide](https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c).

For the test configuration I used the following tutorials:

* [Mocking AWS with Jest](https://dev.to/elthrasher/mocking-aws-with-jest-and-typescript-199i)
* [Unit tests for AWS SDK v3 with Jest: Testing S3](https://medium.com/codex/unit-tests-for-aws-sdk-v3-with-jest-testing-s3-a271163d2d2d)
* [Import ioredis-mock correctly in jest](https://9to5tutorial.com/typescript-import-ioredis-mock-correctly-in-jest)
* [How to skip tests](https://codewithhugo.com/run-skip-single-jest-test/)
